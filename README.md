## Purpose of project:

This project elaborates the use of Reinforcement Learning for the optimisation of sequences for a disassembly task with a dual-arm robot system. A digital model of the dual-arm Kawasaki duAro1 robot was created in Unity. The model was used in combination with ROS to record a disassembly sequence. The order of the sequences was then trained using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). The trained model was sent to the physical robot and evaluated. The results show that it is possible to find an optimal sequence for a disassembly task using RL.
